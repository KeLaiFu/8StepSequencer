# 8StepSequencer
8 step control voltage sequencer based on LMNC design, with a number of modifications

See schematic for changes from the LMNC version. Main ones are:

* Added rotary switch to select sequence length or pattern
* Added switches to turn off outputs for steps
* Added Zero gate input
* Added "Reverse time" switch (which exchanges the roles of the Forward and Backward gate inputs)

Initially tested and debugged 3 July 2020.
